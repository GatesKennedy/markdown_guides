# _ORIGINAL PROMPT_

Prompt Context:

-   double quotes `"`: denote name and exact strings
-   single quotes `'`: denote terms or phrases that loosely defined or lack confidence in accuracy.
-   objects `<variable>`: strings encapsulated by 3 'back ticks' are to be considered as persistent objects, concepts or entities

Situational Context:

-   I am using a mac with the latest version of MacOS.
-   I have a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 and the entire suite (including Excel) installed.
-   I have large .csv files of type "pub_domino" stored locally and have generated a pivot table for aggregating and displaying the data in my desired format.
-   I have ODBC manager installed.
-   I have a postgres database deployed with Render.com
-   I have .csv files of type "pub_domino" stored in multiple AWS S3 buckets.

My ultimate goals listed below...

1.  `GoalDB`: Connect Excel Desktop to a remote postgres database server hosted on Render.com using an ODBC driver.
    1.  explore, view and interact with the tables contained within the remote postges database.
    2.  Utilize Microsoft Co-Pilot from Excel Desktop to explore and analyze the data contained in the remote postgres database.
2.  `GoalS3`: Connect Excel Desktop to my AWS S3 buckets containing .csv files of type "pub_domino".
    1.  Save a 'pivot table definition' (named "pivot_domino") for future use on other .csv of type "pub_domino"
    2.  Apply "pivot_domino" to the .csv files of type "pub_domino" stored within my AWS S3 buckets.
    3.  Utilize Microsoft Co-Pilot from Excel Desktop to explore and analyze the contents of the .csv files of type "pub_domino" in my AWS S3 buckets.

Please create a detailed 'step-by-step' guide as `guide.md` to accomplishing these goals and provide each block of content for `guide.md` as separate artifacts in markdown format. The resulting instructions should be recursively detailed and include `sub-routines` for requirements and preconditions of each step in the process.

An example of a known `sub-routine` is that using ODBC for database connection requires the user to install 'ODBC manager' for mac using 'brew install...' and a sub-routine for using ODBC with Excel is to 'install or create' a driver 'entity or definition' from within the 'ODBC manager' UI..

`sub-routines` can be recursively nested but it is not necessary to denote these steps in any special or distinctive manner. The only purpose of the sub-routine concept is to ensure that these instructions are exhaustive and for you to anticipate the creation of such.

Follow the instructions below closely...

1. Provide `guide.md` instructions for `GoalDB`
2. Provide `guide.md` instructions for `GoalS3`
3. Provide a summary of concerns, considerations and common hiccups.
